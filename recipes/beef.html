        <h1>Beef and Guinness stew</h1>
        <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The
            maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green
            onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.

            <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4
                minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.
            </li>
            <li>Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Turn heat to high
                under the skillet and sear beef pieces in the hot fat on both sides until browned, about 5 minutes.
                Place beef in the stew pot with bacon, leaving fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned,
                5 to 8 minutes; season with a large pinch of salt. </li>
            <li>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and stir with a wooden
                spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food into the liquid. </li>
